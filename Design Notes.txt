Design Notes

Problems
1.	Do we really need a type identification system for objects? Should we just rely on Lua to
	choke when something's not the right type?
2.	To render the map correctly, we need to add 1 to the viewport dimensions in Map:update(). Is this
	my fuck up?

Map Notes
The map data is a 1D array. Assuming you want the coordinate (x, y), find the tile using this:

	mapWidth * y + x

Tilesets are loaded separately to allow us to swap out tilesets without changing map data. The
tileset image gets sliced into quads and stored in a tiles table.

Every frame, we calculate the map tiles that will be on screen and stick them into tiles.batch,
which then gets drawn in drawMap(). This keeps us from drawing offscreen tiles while keeping
the whole map in memory.

Entity Notes
The base entity class will serve as a root object for all entities. It will define prototype methods
and keep a list of all created entities.

To subclass Entity, create a constructor like this

function MyEntity:new(x, y, width, height, args...)
	local object = Entity:new(x, y, width, height)
	object.args = args
	return object
end

Since the Entity constructor sets the metatable to Entity, any functions not implimented in
MyEntity would be looked up in Entity.
