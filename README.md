An incomplete platformer engine for LÖVE

This was a game engine for a platformer/beat-'em-up I was working on. It was for a game
a friend was designing. That seems to have been put on hold for now.

It was my first time with either Lua or LÖVE, so it's probably not great. I seem to prefer
a class-based OOP language, or maybe I'm just not that good with the whole prototype idea.


Stuff I used
* Art from [Open Game Art](http://opengameart.org)
* Could have sworn I was trying to use [Kikito's Middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass)
